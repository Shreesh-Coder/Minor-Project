# Major project phase 1
## Augmented reality for students and learning enthusiasts

Augmented reality (AR) is an evolving 
technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we learn 
and understand complicated concepts. AR combines real-world 
objects with virtual information to create a hybrid world in
which technology meets reality. This allows pupils to study 
complicated concepts in a more pleasant and simple manner.
Our application facilitates the understanding of complicated 
schematics by using 3D models and accompanying video 
explanations. The software also has interactive features that 
allow learners to effortlessly connect with the application. This 
makes learning more fun and engaging, while also helping 
pupils to better understanding the concepts that they are 
studying.
